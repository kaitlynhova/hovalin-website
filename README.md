# Quick Start Install

Make sure you've installed Node.js - We recommend the latest **Node v0.10.x** release.

Ghost is also compatible with **Node v0.12** and **io.js v1.2**, but please note that these versions are more likely to run into installation problems. May contain nuts. Please use the [forum](https://ghost.org/forum/installation/) for help.

1. Download the [latest release](https://ghost.org/download/) of Ghost
1. Unzip in the location you want to install
1. Fire up a terminal
1. `npm install --production`
1. Start Ghost!
    - Local environment: `npm start`
    - On a server: `npm start --production`
1. `http://localhost:2368/ghost` :tada:

# Developer Install (from git)

```

Install Ghost. If you're running locally, use [master](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/master). For production, use [stable](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/tree/stable). :no_entry_sign::rocket::microscope:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the things!

```bash
grunt init
```

Minify that shit for production?

```bash
grunt prod
```

Start your engines.

```bash
npm start

## running production? Add --production
```

Congrats! You made it. BTW you can also just `npm install ghost` if you're into that sort of thing. NPM afficionados can also read up on using [Ghost as an NPM module](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Using-Ghost-as-an-npm-module).
